# App Logo Design: "Daily Dose"

I have designed a custom Vector Drawable logo for your application. This logo is designed to look professional, modern, and relevant to the "Personal Medicine Companion" theme.

## Visual Concept
The logo combines two core elements:
1.  **The Capsule (Pill):** Represents the core function of medicine management. The pill is split into two halves—Generic Medical Blue (#1976D2) for trust and professionalism, and White (#FFFFFF) for cleanliness and purity.
2.  **The Clock (Time):** Integrated red clock hands overlay the center of the pill. This emphasizes the "Daily" aspect—reminders, scheduling, and timeliness, which is crucial for medication adherence.

## Color Palette
- **Background:** Soft Blue/Cyan (#E3F2FD) - Calming, non-threatening background.
- **Primary:** Medical Blue (#1976D2) - Standard color for healthcare apps.
- **Accent:** Alarm Red (#FF5252) - Used for the clock hands to draw attention to the "time" aspect without being too aggressive.

## File Location
The vector asset has been created at:
`app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_logo_daily_dose.xml`

## How to use
You can use this drawable as an image source in your layouts:
```xml
<ImageView
    android:layout_width="100dp"
    android:layout_height="100dp"
    android:src="@drawable/ic_logo_daily_dose" />
```

Or you can set it as your app icon by configuring your `AndroidManifest.xml` and adaptive icon resources.
